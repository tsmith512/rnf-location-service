# Location Tracker v2

Rebuild of the original Location Tracker service for Route Not Found. With, hopefully, a cleaner API.

Primary Inputs:

- Location waypoints from Tasker
- Trip information from TBD backend admin

Primary Outputs:

- Waypoint and trip data for WordPress
- Debug and stats info for TBD backend admin

Data:

- A `waypoint` is a specific geographic location with a timestamp and, optionally, geocoded information
- A `trip` is a date range and a name which collects waypoints

**This describes the API endpoint exposed by the middleware,** not the API exposed by PostgreSQL/PostgREST that the middleware uses. Trying to make both sides match got weird.

# Group Waypoints

## Create Waypoint [/waypoint]

### Create Waypoint [POST]

**I want to completely change this. This method is still v1.**

Updates should be queued client-side and submitted as a plain-text CSV file. Your API key must be submitted as a query argument; the CSV text goes in the body of the request.

There is a Tasker task template in the repository in the `/tasker` directory to do this.

HTTP Basic Authentication is required.
